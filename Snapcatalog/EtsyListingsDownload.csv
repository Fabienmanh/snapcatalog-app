"Replacement Cover - Sonic Spinball (PAL Version) - SEGA Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball, also known as Sonic Spinball, is a 1993 pinball video game developed by Sega Technical Institute and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It is a spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who must stop Doctor Robotnik from enslaving the population in a giant pinball-like mechanism. The game is set in a series of pinball machine-like environments with Sonic acting as the pinball.

It was developed by the American staff of Sega Technical Institute, as the Japanese staff was occupied with developing Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. When Sega management realized that Sonic 3 would not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday shopping season, they commissioned another Sonic game. After a hasty nine-month[5] development, Sonic Spinball was released for the Sega Genesis in November 1993, with ports for the Game Gear and Master System releasing in 1994.

"Replacement Cover - Alex Kidd In Miracle World (PAL Version) - SEGA Master System Classic Reproduction Game Cover -  - High Quality Print","Alex Kidd in Miracle World (アレックスキッドのミラクルワールド) is a video game released in 1986 by Sega for the Sega Master System console. It is the first of several games in the Alex Kidd series, starring a character which would serve as the company's mascot for half a decade before being replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog.

Alex Kidd in Miracle World stands as one of the more popular Master System releases, having been built into many Master System consoles during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is also one of the few Master System games to have an official Korean translation. Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle may be considered a direct sequel to this game, as it continues the story of Alex's search for his father, King Sander (a.k.a. King Thunder).

"Replacement Cover - Rule Of Rose (PAL FR Version) - Sony PlayStation 2 Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print 600 DPI","Rule of Rose is a survival horror video game developed by Punchline for the PlayStation 2. Set in England in 1930, the plot revolves around a nineteen-year-old woman named Jennifer, who becomes trapped in a world ruled by young girls who have established a class hierarchy called the Red Crayon Aristocrats. It was first released in 2006 by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan. After Sony Computer Entertainment's American and European branch did not express interest in localizing the title, it was published later that year by Atlus USA in North America and by 505 Games in Europe.

Development on Rule of Rose began after Punchline was asked by Sony Computer Entertainment to make a horror game. Punchline wanted to develop a ""new type of horror game"" with an emphasis on psychological horror. This decision led to the concept of childhood, specifically the ""mysterious and misunderstood"" nature of young girls. The team drew inspiration from the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tales for the narrative, and the Silent Hill series for graphics and art style. The entire score was produced by studio musicians in order to bring a human element to the game's atmosphere.

"Replacement Cover - Silent Hill 2 (PAL UK Version) - Playstation 2 Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print 600 DPI","Silent Hill 2 is a 2001 survival horror game developed by Team Silent, a group in Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, and published by Konami. The game was released from September to November, originally for the PlayStation 2. The second installment in the Silent Hill series, Silent Hill 2 centres on James Sunderland, a widower who journeys to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife informing him that she is waiting there for him. An extended version containing an extra bonus scenario, Born from a Wish, and other additions was published for Xbox in December of the same year. In 2002, it was ported to Microsoft Windows and re-released for the PlayStation 2 as a Greatest Hits version, which includes all bonus content from the Xbox port. A remastered high-definition version was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012 as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection.

Development of Silent Hill 2 began in June 1999, soon after Silent Hill had been completed. Its narrative was inspired by the Russian novel Crime and Punishment (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on the game's artistic style include the work of film directors David Lynch and Adrian Lyne (specifically Jacob's Ladder), and paintings by Francis Bacon and Andrew Wyeth; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. In contrast with the previous title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, Silent Hill 2 focuses directly on the psychology of its characters.

Released from August to December, originally for the PlayStation 2, it is the first installment in the Devil May Cry series. Set in modern times on the fictional Mallet Island, the story centers on Dante, a demon hunter who uses his business to carry out a lifelong vendetta against all demons. He meets a woman named Trish who takes him on a journey to defeat the demon lord Mundus, who is responsible for the deaths of Dante's brother and mother. The story is told primarily through a mixture of cutscenes, which use the game engine and several pre-rendered full motion videos. The game is very loosely based on the Italian poem Divine Comedy by the use of allusions, including the game's protagonist Dante (named after Dante Alighieri) and other characters like Trish (Beatrice Portinari) and Vergil (Vergil).

"Replacement Cover - California Games - SEGA Megadrive Replacement Classic Cover - High Quality Print","California Games, known in Brazil as Jogos de Verão, is a sports game developed by Epyx for numerous home computers and consoles, as part of their Games series, following Summer Games and World Games.

The first Sega version was a Master System conversion developed by Sega themselves and released in 1989, which, like the similar NES version from around the same time, was mainly based off of the Commodore 64 version. Later, in 1991, a Mega Drive version, this time developed by Novotrade, was released, which featured brand new graphics in comparison to the other versions as well as slightly different play mechanics, but at the same time removed the Flying Disc event and the sponsorship that was present on all other versions.

Much later, during the mid-90s, the Master System version was cut-up and re-released by Tec Toy as a ""compilation"" entitled Game Box Série Esportes Radicais, which only kept the surfing and BMX events.

"Replacement Cover - Kuon (PAL Multi Version) - Sony PlayStation 2 Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print 600 DPI","Kuon is a 2004 survival horror video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. Published by FromSoftware in Japan, it was released in North America by Agetec, and in Europe by Nobilis and Indie Games Productions in 2006. The narrative takes place in Japan's Heian period, and follows the actions of three protagonists during an outbreak of monsters at Fujiwara Manor in Kyoto; Utsuki, daughter of the onmyōji Ashiya Doman, Doman's apprentice Sakuya, and the veteran onmyōji Abe no Seimei. Gameplay has the different characters exploring the grounds and buildings of Fujiwara Manor, solving puzzles and fighting off hostile monsters.

The game was conceived by its producer Atsushi Taniguchi. His aim was to create a dark narrative based around Japanese kaidan ghost stories, with a focus on female protagonists. The gameplay was designed as an evolution of the company's earlier title Lost Kingdoms. The artwork was handled by Nozomu Iwai, with promotional artwork designed by Kyosuke Chinai. Reception was mixed, with praise going to its atmosphere while many journalists faulted its controls and gameplay.

"Replacement Cover - Sonic The Hedgehog (Japanese Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega in 1991 for the Genesis/Mega Drive. It was released in North America on June 23 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, who can run at near supersonic speeds; Sonic sets out on a quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and seeks the powerful Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.

Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. The developers chose a blue hedgehog designed by Naoto Oshima after he won an internal character design contest, and named themselves Sonic Team to match their character. It uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery which was based on a concept by Oshima from 1989. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. The music was composed by Masato Nakamura, bassist of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.

Sonic the Hedgehog was very well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It is widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time and became one of the best-selling video games of all time with approximately 24 million copies sold worldwide. It established the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowed it to compete with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It has been ported to multiple systems and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It was followed by Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992.

『ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ』 (SONIC THE HEDGEHOG) は、セガ・エンタープライゼス（現・株式会社セガ）が1991年7月26日に発売したメガドライブ用アクションゲーム[4]。ソニックシリーズ第1作。略称はソニック1。

100万本以上の売り上げが見込めるソフトとして開発され、本体同梱版 (北米版) を含め、全世界で1500万本以上を売り上げた。なお、アメリカのジェネシス（日本国外版メガドライブ）では同年6月23日、日本より先に発売された[5]。国外版の内容は概ね日本版と同じだが、演出やボーナスなどに微妙な差異がある。

また、日本国外では同名タイトルだが内容の異なるSEGA MASTER SYSTEM版（日本ではゲームギア用ソフトとして）が開発・リリースされている。本項では同版についても「#8ビット版」の節で併せて解説する。

BGMはDREAMS COME TRUEの中村正人により作曲され、一部の曲がNEW UFOキャッチャーでも使用されている[6]（後節も参照）。

"Replacement Cover - Mc Donald's Treasure Land Adventure (Jap Version) - SEGA Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a 1993 platform game developed by Treasure and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive. Based on the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain, specifically its McDonaldland marketing campaign, players control Ronald McDonald in his efforts to retrieve the missing pieces of a map that lead to the location of a buried treasure from a group of villains.

Treasure Land Adventure was developed by Treasure in conjunction with the run and gun video game Gunstar Heroes (1993). Sega commissioned Treasure to design a McDonald's game after the company was ineligible to receive a publishing contract to develop games for the Genesis. Treasure president and project programmer Masato Maegawa mandated that the game had to be faithful and respectful to the McDonald's licensing and characters during production.

"Replacement Cover - Gunstar Heroes (Japanese Version) - SEGA Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Gunstar Heroes is a run and gun video game developed by Treasure and published by Sega. It was Treasure's debut game, originally released for the Sega Genesis in 1993. The game's premise is centered around a pair of characters, the Gunstars, in their efforts to stop an evil empire from recovering four powerful gems. The characters can fire guns and perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers to fight enemies across each stage. There are four weapons in the game which can be combined with one another to create different shot types.

Development on Gunstar Heroes began among a team of staff working at Konami in 1991. Following an unwillingness of Konami to embrace their original game ideas, the team quit in 1992 and formed Treasure to see their project through. The team wanted to develop their game for the Genesis because of the system's powerful Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Sega initially rejected their proposal, but later granted approval after they had been working for Sega for several months on McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure (1993). Treasure worked on both games in parallel, and released Gunstar Heroes worldwide as their first game in 1993.

"Replacement Cover - Castlevania Bloodlines (US Version) - Sega Genesis Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Castlevania: Bloodlines, known in Japan as Vampire Killer[a] and in Europe and Australia as Castlevania: The New Generation, is a platform game developed and published by Konami in 1994 for the Sega Genesis, part of the Castlevania series. A vampire named Elizabeth Bartley is orchestrating the beginning of World War I as a sacrificial war to bring her uncle, Dracula, back to life. Players take on the role of Quincey Morris' son, John, and his friend Eric Lecarde to take up the fight against evil.

The development team approached Bloodlines as a unique Castlevania experience tailor-made for the Genesis. In this sense, the gameplay was made more fast and action-oriented. Writer Toshiki Yamamura also took creative liberties to craft what he viewed was a new chapter in the Castlevania saga. The game was the first Castlevania title for which Michiru Yamane composed music. She used her Bach influences to compose a renowned soundtrack, leading to her becoming a recurring series composer.

"Replacement Cover - Undeadline (Jap Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Repdroduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Undeadline is a 1989 vertically scrolling shooter video game developed and originally published by T&E Soft for the MSX2 and MSX2+ home computers. It was later ported to the X68000 computer and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, published by Palsoft, followed by digital re-releases for Microsoft Windows. Both the MSX2 and X68000 versions also received physical re-releases by Japanese retailer BEEP. It follows a group of characters in rescue of queen Althea from Zidane, a kingdom surrounded by barriers connected with the demon world, whose monsters have overflowed it. Controlling either a fighter, wizard, or ninja, the player can choose from six stages and play them in any order, fighting against waves of enemies and bosses, while defending or avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles.

Undeadline was directed and designed by Tokihiro Naito, who previously worked on Hydlide and Hydlide 3, with Tetsuya ""Futaro"" Yamamoto serving as main programmer. The soundtrack was composed by Kazunori Hasegawa. Due to T&E Soft liking to push its playtesters to the limits and as their skills improved naturally, it led to the designers increasing the difficulty to keep up with them, particularly paying attention to both enemy movement and spawn patterns. Because of its rarity, original copies of the MSX2 version commands high prices on the secondary game collecting market. The game received generally favorable reception from critics, most of which reviewed it as an import title, although its difficulty has been criticized.

『アンデッドライン』 (UNDEADLINE) は、1989年7月22日に日本のT&E SOFTから発売されたMSX2用縦スクロールシューティングゲーム。

開発はT&E SOFTが行い、ゲーム・デザインおよびディレクターは内藤時浩、音楽は『遥かなるオーガスタ』（1989年）を手掛けた長谷川和伯が担当している。MSX2版は128KBのVRAMとフロッピーディスクドライブが必要となっており、またMSX-MUSIC(YM2413)に対応している。

"Replacement Cover - Aero Blasters (Jap Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Air Buster is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developed by Kaneko. It was published by Namco in Japan and Sharp Image Electronics in North America (licensed from Namco). Two players control the ""Blaster Fighter"" star ships in their efforts to destroy a mysterious mechanical fortress orbiting Earth, with plans to take control of the planet. The Blaster Fighters can equip one of seven available weapons, which will change the ship's firepower and abilities, such as diagonal shots, homing missiles and small drones that follow the player's ship.

Air Buster received a favorable reception for its visuals, sound effects and gameplay, although complaints were directed at the difficulty, which was deemed ""too easy"" by numerous publications. Ports of the game were released for both the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Genesis, the former being renamed to Aero Blasters for international releases. The Sega Genesis release was ported over to the ""Project EGG"" digital storefront in 2014, which remained exclusive to Japan. A version for the X68000 was in development but never released.

"Replacement Cover - Final Fantasy XII (PAL Uk Version) - Sony Playstation 2 Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print 600 DPI","Final Fantasy XII is a 2006 role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. The twelfth main installment of the Final Fantasy series, it was first released for the PlayStation 2 in March 2006. It introduced several innovations to the series: an open world; a seamless battle system; a controllable camera; a customizable ""gambit"" system, which lets the player control the artificial intelligence (AI) of characters in battle; a ""license"" system, which determines what abilities and equipment can be used by characters; and hunting side quests, which allows the player to find and defeat increasingly difficult monsters in the game's open world. Final Fantasy XII also includes elements from previous games in the series, such as Chocobos and Moogles.

The game takes place in Ivalice, where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war. Dalmasca, a small kingdom, is caught between the warring nations. When Dalmasca is annexed by Archadia, its princess, Ashe, creates a resistance movement. During the struggle, she meets Vaan, a young adventurer who dreams of becoming a sky pirate in command of an airship. They are quickly joined by a band of allies; together, they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire.

"Replacement Cover - Steel Empire (Jap Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku (鋼鉄帝国, lit. ""Empire of Steel"") in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel) is a horizontally scrolling shooter released on the Sega Genesis in 1992. Versions for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 3DS were released in 2004 and 2014, respectively. The game is scheduled for release on the Nintendo Switch in 2023.

Steel Empire is notable among shoot 'em ups for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in a late-19th century alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, power-ups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles as the game's protagonists and opponents.

『鋼鉄帝国』（こうてつていこく）は、1992年3月13日に日本のホット・ビィから発売されたメガドライブ用横スクロールシューティングゲーム。

18XX年を舞台に自機の「エトピリカ」および「ゼッペロン」を操作し、軍事国家モーターヘッドの侵略からシルバーヘッド共和国を守る事を目的としている。スチームパンクに影響された独特の世界観や自機のレベルアップ制などを特徴としている。

開発はホット・ビィが行い、プロデューサーはX68000用ソフト『スーパー上海 ドラゴンズアイ』（1990年）を手掛けた朝長彰教、コ・ディレクターはファミリーコンピュータ用ソフト『オーバーホライゾン』（1991年）を手掛けた佐武義訓、音楽はファミリーコンピュータ用ソフト『オペレーションウルフ』（1989年）を手掛けた溝口功、メガドライブ用ソフト『ブルーアルマナック』（1991年）を手掛けた窪寺義明および岩垂徳行が担当している。

"Replacement Cover - Verytex (Jap Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Verytex is a vertically scrolling shooter video game developed by Opera House, with the assistance of ISCO, and published by Asmik Ace Entertainment exclusively for the Mega Drive in Japan on 5 April 1991. Taking place on the colonized fictional planet of Syracuse in a futuristic sci-fi setting, where its military force initiated a violent coup d'état against the inhabitants for unknown reasons, players take control of the titular space fighter craft in an attempt to overthrow the enemies, protect civilization and discover the true cause for the rebellion.

Headed by Air Diver producer Toshiyuki Futamura, Verytex was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects such as the Mega Drive conversion of Master of Monsters. Despite being exclusive to Japan, the game has received mixed reviews from critics and from reviewers that reviewed it as an import title, who felt divided in regards to several areas of the title such as the presentation, graphics, sound design, controls and gameplay, although the music was noted by some people as a positive point.

They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe (hence the page name) despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand as Devil's Crush. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.

The player controls an American F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and must clear each of the game's eighteen unique stages by destroying incoming enemies.

It runs on the Sega X Board arcade system which is capable of surface and sprite rotation. It is the fourth Sega game to use a hydraulic ""taikan"" motion simulator arcade cabinet, one that is more elaborate than their earlier ""taikan"" simulator games. The cabinet simulates an aircraft cockpit, with flight stick controls, a chair with seatbelt, and hydraulic motion technology that moves, tilts, rolls and rotates the cockpit in sync with the on-screen action.

"Replacement Cover - Musha (PAL Version) - Sega Megadrive  Replacement Custom Game Cover - High Quality Print","MUSHA is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Compile and released for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive in 1990. An entry in Compile's shooter series, Aleste, MUSHA places the player in the role of a flying mecha pilot who must destroy a large super intelligent computer threatening planet Earth. The game had a working title of Aleste 2 and originally featured a style similar to the first game, but this was changed to a more original Japanese aesthetic and speed metal soundtrack.

Initial reception for MUSHA was mixed. Critics generally agreed the game was enjoyable with great graphics, but found themselves overwhelmed by the number of scrolling shooters on the Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable and lacked challenge.

"Replacement Cover - Double Dragon (PAL/US Version) - Sega Megadrive/Genesis Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Double Dragon is a 1987 beat 'em up video game developed by Technōs Japan and distributed by Taito for arcades across Asia, North America and Europe. It is the first title in the Double Dragon franchise. The game's development was led by Yoshihisa Kishimoto, and it is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (1986), released outside of Japan by Taito as Renegade; Kishimoto originally envisioned it as a direct sequel and part of the Kunio-kun series, before making it a new game with a different cast and setting.

Double Dragon introduced several additions to the Kunio-kun belt scroll beat 'em up formula, such as a continuous side-scrolling world adding a sense of progression, two-player cooperative gameplay, the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them, and the use of cut scenes to give it a cinematic look and feel. The game's title is a reference to the two-player gameplay and Bruce Lee's martial arts film Enter the Dragon (1973), which was a major inspiration behind Kunio-kun and Double Dragon, while the game's art style and setting were influenced by the Mad Max films and Fist of the North Star manga and anime series.

Double Dragon was one of the first successful beat 'em up games, becoming Japan's third highest-grossing table arcade game of 1987 before becoming America's highest-grossing dedicated arcade game for two years in a row, in 1988 and 1989. It also received critical acclaim, with Electronic Gaming Monthly awarding it 1988 Game of the Year. Its success resulted in the creation of the Double Dragon franchise, including two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, and it ushered in a ""Golden Age"" for the beat 'em up genre, establishing the conventions for a wave of beat 'em ups from other companies during the late 1980s to 1990s. Originally an arcade game, home versions were released for the NES, Master System, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Game Boy, Genesis/Mega Drive, and Atari Lynx, among other platforms during the series's height of popularity. A remake titled Double Dragon Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.

"Replacement Cover - Eternal Champions - SEGA Megadrive Custom Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Eternal Champions is a 1993 fighting game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was one of the few fighting games of its time developed from the ground up as a home console title, rather than being released in arcades first and later ported to home systems.

Sega released Eternal Champions in hopes of capitalizing on the fighting game mania that the game industry was in the midst of following the massive success of Street Fighter II (1991) and Mortal Kombat (1992). The game tried to set itself apart with unique features such as a heavier emphasis on its story, characters pulled from different time periods, reflectable projectiles, force fields, fighters that carried weapons, a training mode where players had to defend themselves against robotic traps, a novel method of executing moves, and elaborate stage-specific finishing moves called ""Overkills"".

"Replacement Cover - Michael Jackson's MoonWalker (PAL Version) - Sega Megadrive Replacement Classic Game Cover - High Quality Print","Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is the name of several video games based on the 1988 Michael Jackson film Moonwalker. Sega developed two beat 'em ups, released in 1990; one released in arcades and another released for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive and Master System consoles. U.S. Gold also published various games for home computers the same year. Each of the games' plots loosely follows the ""Smooth Criminal"" segment of the film, in which Jackson rescues kidnapped children from the evil Mr. Big, and incorporates synthesized versions of some of the musician's songs. Following Moonwalker, Jackson collaborated with Sega on several other video games.

"Replacement Cover - Landstalker (FR Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Landstalker : Le Trésor du Roi Nole, est un jeu vidéo de type action-aventure incluant de nombreuses phases de plates-formes. Initialement le titre sort en octobre 1992 au Japon sur Mega Drive, il connait une sortie mondiale l'année suivante et est officiellement disponible en quatre langues : japonais, anglais, français et allemand. Il est développé par Climax Entertainment, studio qui a précédemment travaillé sur Shining in the Darkness ainsi que sur le premier Shining Force.

Créé à l'origine pour devenir — à l'instar de la série des The Legend of Zelda de Nintendo — le jeu d'aventure phare de la console de Sega, Landstalker n'en est toutefois pas un clone comme ont pu l'être Golden Axe Warrior sur Master System, voire plus tard Soleil sur Mega Drive, ne serait-ce qu'à cause de son choix de vue de trois quarts en 3D isométrique.

"Replacement Cover - Strider (PAL Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Game Cover - High Quality Print","Strider, released in Japan as Strider Hiryū, is a hack-and-slash platform game released in arcades in 1989 by Capcom. Strider is set in a dystopian future with a wide range of settings that affect gameplay. The game resulted from cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher Moto Kikaku. It marked the video game debut of Strider Hiryu, after the character was introduced in the 1988 manga Strider Hiryu.

The game debuted on Capcom's CP System arcade board. Various home computer ports were developed by Tiertex and published by U.S. Gold in 1989. The NES version has a different plot than the original. Sega released Strider for its own Genesis console in 1990. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from Electronic Gaming Monthly in 1990.

"Replacement Cover - V-V (Japanese Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Grind Stormer is a 1993 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed and published by Toaplan in Japan and North America. It is considered to be the spiritual successor to Slap Fight. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft in an attempt to defeat the titular virtual reality simulator, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose.

Headed by DonPachi producer Kenichi Takano, Grind Stormer was created by a small development team of new employees at Toaplan who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to V・V in Japan. It is notable for marking the debut of Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda in the video game industry, serving as one of its programmers and features a much smaller hitbox for the ship compared with previous shoot 'em up games released at the time. It is also notable for being one of the last games by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack, as the company began to clear out their FM chip inventory. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and a month later in North America, featuring both the original Japanese and North American versions as selectable gameplay modes.

"Replacement Cover - ToeJam & Earl (PAL Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Game Cover - High Quality Print","ToeJam & Earl (トージャム＆アール) is a Sega Mega Drive action strategy game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega. Starring two extraterrestrial rappers who crash-land on Earth and must re-assemble the missing pieces of their spacecraft, it was first released in the United States in October 1991, and was generally well-received for both its charming parodies of 1990s urban culture and for its funk-inspired soundtrack. The success of ToeJam & Earl was followed by a sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, and helped to establish the duo as one of Sega of America's earliest mascots.
With a notably lighthearted tone, ToeJam & Earl's carefree design and fun characterization resulted in the game becoming one of Sega of America's more fondly-remembered original titles, both upon its release and into the modern era. Today, the duo are still strongly-associated with Sega's name in the United States, and has ensured the franchise still sees modern ports and newly-developed games.

"Replacement Cover - Musha (Us Version) - Sega Genesis Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","MUSHA is a vertically scrolling shooter developed by Compile and released for the Sega Genesis in 1990. An entry in Compile's shooter series, Aleste, MUSHA places the player in the role of a flying mecha pilot who must destroy a large super intelligent computer threatening planet Earth. The game had a working title of Aleste 2 and originally featured a style similar to the first game, but this was changed to a more original Japanese aesthetic and speed metal soundtrack.

Initial reception for MUSHA was mixed. Critics generally agreed the game was enjoyable with great graphics, but found themselves overwhelmed by the number of scrolling shooters on the Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable and lacked challenge.

"Replacement Cover - Mc Donald's Treasure Land Adventure (PAL Version) - SEGA Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a 1993 platform game developed by Treasure and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis/Megadrive. Based on the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain, specifically its McDonaldland marketing campaign, players control Ronald McDonald in his efforts to retrieve the missing pieces of a map that lead to the location of a buried treasure from a group of villains. Ronald can defeat enemies by using a magic attack and can latch onto hooks with his scarf to reach higher platforms.

Treasure Land Adventure was developed by Treasure in conjunction with the run and gun video game Gunstar Heroes (1993). Sega commissioned Treasure to design a McDonald's game after the company was ineligible to receive a publishing contract to develop games for the Genesis. Treasure president and project programmer Masato Maegawa mandated that the game had to be faithful and respectful to the McDonald's licensing and characters during production.

"Replacement Cover - Mega Key (Brazilian Version) - Sega Megadrive Classic Reproduction Game Cover","The Sega Mega Drive was Sega's first console to offer games which were region locked, i.e. cartridges which can only be played on specific regional hardware. To overcome this problem one solution was to use a Mega Drive Region Converter.

From a Sega perspective there are three ""main"" regions - NTSC-J, the format used for consoles in Japan, NTSC-U, the format used in North America, and PAL, used in Europe and Australia. Other regions would pick one of the three formats - Brazil typically went for NTSC-U and Asia used a mixture of PAL and NTSC depending on the country. There are other forms of region locking too - Japanese cartridges are a different shape than their western counterparts and won't physically fit in some consoles (similar to the ""region locking"" of the Sega Master System).

Traditionally this means a game intended for use with a North American Sega Genesis could not work on a European Sega Mega Drive. There are, in fact, many exceptions to this rule as not all software was region locked on the system, but in many cases there was still an obstruction. Region encoding would generally have a greater impact with the Sega Mega-CD, Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast - in the early 1990s few people contemplated the idea of importing games as there were often no easy methods of doing so.

There are no official Mega Drive region converters but numerous unlicensed third party ones. Most typically originate from Asia where there was far less regulation on this sort of thing and numerous television standards between countries. In all cases a region converter is inserted into a Mega Drive system in-between the console and game cartridge, forming a ""tower"" (and avoiding sizing issues in the process). Some region converters have switches to toggle between regions, while others merely convert to a specific region.

In no cases do Mega Drive region converters solve coding issues. For example, a game designed for 60Hz NTSC televisions will run roughly 17% slower on a 50Hz PAL television due to the difference in refresh rate (and likewise a European game running on an NTSC TV will likely run too fast). Resolutions can also differ - PAL Mega Drives can in theory display 320x240 images while NTSC ones can only achieve 320x224, though very few games take advantage of the extra sixteen rows of pixels.

It should be noted that some devices such as the Game Genie can also act as region converters. More recent consoles by AtGames have region converting features built in (and of course there is always the option of modifying the internals of the console manually.)

"Replacement Cover - Castlevania Bloodlines (PAL Version) - Sega Genesis Custom Reproduction Game Cover - High Quality Print","Castlevania: Bloodlines, known in Japan as Vampire Killer[a] and in Europe and Australia as Castlevania: The New Generation, is a platform game developed and published by Konami in 1994 for the Sega Genesis, part of the Castlevania series. A vampire named Elizabeth Bartley is orchestrating the beginning of World War I as a sacrificial war to bring her uncle, Dracula, back to life. Players take on the role of Quincey Morris' son, John, and his friend Eric Lecarde to take up the fight against evil.

The development team approached Bloodlines as a unique Castlevania experience tailor-made for the Genesis. In this sense, the gameplay was made more fast and action-oriented. Writer Toshiki Yamamura also took creative liberties to craft what he viewed was a new chapter in the Castlevania saga. The game was the first Castlevania title for which Michiru Yamane composed music. She used her Bach influences to compose a renowned soundtrack, leading to her becoming a recurring series composer.

Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and originally released for arcades in 1991. It is the second installment in the Street Fighter series and the sequel to 1987's Street Fighter. It is Capcom's fourteenth game to use the CP System arcade system board. Street Fighter II vastly improved many of the concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of special command-based moves, a combo system, a six-button configuration, and a wider selection of playable characters, each with a unique fighting style.

It prominently features a popular two-player mode that obligates direct, human-to-human competitive play which prolonged the survival of the declining video-game arcade business market by stimulating business and driving the fighter genre.[11][12] It inspired grassroots tournament events, culminating in Evolution Championship Series (EVO).[13][12] Street Fighter II shifted the arcade competitive dynamic from achieving personal-best high scores to head-to-head competition, including large groups.

Mortal Kombat (モータルコンバット), also known as Mortal Kombat Kanzen-ban (モータルコンバット完全版) on the Mega-CD in Japan, is a 1992 arcade fighting game by Midway Manufacturing. At the time, it was considered revolutionary for its use of digitized graphics, though it was also met with controversy thanks to its high levels of violence.

Following its release in the arcades, home versions were created and released in September 1993 on a date which became known as ""Mortal Monday"". This date saw Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System, and Sega Game Gear versions of the game (among versions for other systems), published by Arena Entertainment simultaneously in North America and Europe, although Japan and Brazil were forced to wait some months later. A Sega Mega-CD version did not arrive until 1994.
